                    liquid at the top level before time runs out or the enemy (coronavirus) catches you.</p><p>You \
                    can change the difficulty of the game by clicking the buttons at the top of the screen. Note \
                    that changing this will also change the score in the top right corner. When you get to the first\
                     level, the game will start and the score will tick down. If you go for 'Easy' mode. Your score \
                     starts at 75. 'Medium' starts at 100 and 'Hard' at 125. This also means you have less time to \
                     complete the game. You have 25, 35, and 45 seconds to complete easy, medium, and hard \
                     respectively.</p><h1>Controls</h1><p>UP Arrow or W to climb when on a ladder</p><p>DOWN Arrow or \

                     I wasn't sure what to do. I had a few ideas, such as:<ul><li>A movie database (like \
                    <a href='https://www.letterboxd.com'>Letterboxd</a>)</li><li>A replica of a famous arcade \
                    game which involves a yellow monster ruthlessly murdering his stalker ghosts (they were \
                    just following orders!)</li><li>another replica of a game Nintendo made back in the day \
                    with some kind of gorilla throwing barrels at a moustache'd plumber trying to keep the \
                    princess safe, only for the plumber to kidnap the princess in the end.</li></ul></p>\
                    <p>After thinking about it for a few days, I decided to try and recreate the Nintendo \
                    game. Another day later, when I realised how big and scary the Nintendo trademark is, \
                    I decided to come up with my own game which would be loosely based on the two games I \
                    describe above.</p>"
