# climb-game
This is a project I made in first year Computer Science. It's a game where the goal is to reach the top before the enemy catches you.

We were assigned this project just before the first lockdown in Ireland, so this enabled me to work on the project during the lockdown and refine it as much as I could.

Given a brief to develop a JavaScript based game. Created a game where the user controlled a small blue square that had to climb up a set of platforms using ladders. The goal was to reach the top, where the vaccine was, before the enemy, a coronavirus sprite, caught you. Took a keen interest in this project and decided to implement a leader-board which kept track of the high score for everyone who played it using MySQL and Python as the server-side language.
