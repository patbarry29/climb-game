# climb-game
This is a project I made in first year Computer Science. It's a game where the goal is to reach the top before the enemy catches you.

We were assigned this project just before the first lockdown in Ireland, so this enabled me to work on the project during the lockdown and refine it as much as I could.
Some of the basic functions of the character took me a while to get right, but once I got them down, I was flying it.
